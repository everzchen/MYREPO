#Presenting Data: Plotting Conditional Means {#plot_means}

The idea when plotting conditional means is to show how the outcome, or variable of interest, varies as a function of predictors. 

Today we'll be working with a dataset from IBM which provide a standard HR dataset, which we can use to predict attrition. (*NB this is simulated data, no employee information is being disclosed*) Attrition in this case is defined as an employee leaving without being fired or retiring. Companies generally attempt to avoid attrition, as it's very expensive to search for and hire a replacement-- better in general to keep the employees you have, provided they are doing their jobs. This means that it's important to predict who might leave in a given year. This information can be used in a targeted way in order to focus resources on the employees most likely to leave. 

## Setup for plotting conditional means

We start with a standard set of setup commands. Today we'll be working with `tidyverse`, as usual, along with a library called `forcats` which helps us to deal with the dreaded factor variables. To handle colors, we'll need the package `RColorBrewer.`

```{r  include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(forcats)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(knitr)
```

Next we load in the data.

## Loading Data 
```{r}
load("attrition.Rdata")
```

Today, our primary outcome of interest will be attrition. This is a binary variable that is currently encoded as text-- "Yes" or "No." We need to encode it as a binary variable with 1 meaning yes and 0 meaning no. 1 = already left, 0 = not. After recoding, we need to make sure that the new variable looks correct.

```{r}
## Create a new variable named attrit and define it as 0.
### If attrition is yes, then it is defined as 1. Anything else is defined as 0.
at<-at%>%mutate(attrit=ifelse(Attrition=="Yes",1,0))

##Table of old Attrition variable
table(at$Attrition)

##Table of new attrit variable
table(at$attrit)

table(at$attrit,at$Attrition)
```

Output shows that 237 employees left, 1233 employees did not leave the organization. 

##Univariate Graphics

Univariate graphics help us understand what individual variables look like-- how are they distibuted across the sample? Here's a quick rundown on some univariate graphics. Say we wanted a quick count of who was in each department. We can use geom_bar to get this done. By default, this will give us a count in each department. 

Frequency plot: We will use the ggplot command, telling the program what dataset to use, and give it the aesthetic. X-axis = department, fill of color = Department. We ask for a barplot.

```{r}
gg<-ggplot(at,aes(x=Department,fill=Department))
gg<-gg+geom_bar()
gg
``` 

The next univariate graphic you should know is for continuous variables. The first thing you generally want is a histogram. 

```{r}
gg<-ggplot(at,aes(x=DistanceFromHome))
gg<-gg+geom_histogram(binwidth = 1,fill="lightblue")
gg
``` 

Density plots provide a continous graphic of the distribution of a variable:
```{r}
gg<-ggplot(at,aes(x=DistanceFromHome))
gg<-gg+geom_density()
gg

## Changing bandwidth-- not recommended, just showing you how. It smooths out the density plot. Instead of the bandwidth = 1 mile, it is now 10 miles. 
gg<-gg+geom_density(bw=10)
gg
```


## Predicting Attrition

Our first prediction will use business travel as a predictor for attrition. There are three categories here-- non travel, travel infrequently, and frequent travel. We'll calculate levels of attrition at each level and then take a look at the data. 

We are going to create a new dataset, called 'at_sum'. Using the group_by command and the summarize command, we are going to create a new variable, 'attr_avg' set equal to the mean attrition for each of the business travel categories. 

```{r}

at_sum<-at%>%
  group_by(BusinessTravel)%>%
  summarize(attr_avg=mean(attrit))

at_sum

```

8% of non-travel employees left the organization last year. About 25% of those who travel frequently left, and 15% of those who travel rarely left the organization last year.

Remember that the mean of a binary variable indicates the proportion of the population that has a certain characteristcs. So, in our case, `r  round(at_sum$attr_avg[2],2)` of the sample that travels frequently left the company in the last year. Our first plot will be a basic bar plot, showing the average levels of attrition. 

To get started, let's see what this looks like in a table.
```{r}
at %>%
  count(BusinessTravel,attrit) %>%
  group_by(BusinessTravel)%>%
  mutate(prop = prop.table(n)) %>%
  select(-n) %>%
  spread(attrit, prop)%>%kable()
```

Now we can plot it:

```{r}
## Bar Plot with aesthetics: mean attrition as height, business travel as category
gg<-ggplot(at_sum,aes(x=BusinessTravel,y=attr_avg))
## Use bar plot geometry, height of bars set by level observed in dataset. The Identity tasks it to plot what is in the dataset.
gg<-gg+geom_bar(stat="Identity")
## Print
gg
```

This is fine, but it should really be in the order of the underlying variable. We can use `fct_reorder` to do this. A factor variable is not ordered, does not have any particular numeric values that would be associated with it. We're going to reorder by the levels of attrition.

_Side_ _Note_

What is a factor variable? In R, factor variables are used for categorical data. These are data elements that can take on one and only one value of a mutually exclusive and exhaustive list of elements. In our case, the travel variable is a factor-- employees can be in Non-Travel, Travel Frequently or Travel Rarely bins. Everyone is one bin, and the bins cover all possible options. We use factors when numbers won't work-- for characteristics like race or religion or political affiliation. 

fct_reorder = reorder Business Travel by average attrition.
```{r}
## Same asethetics, but now orderred by level
gg<-ggplot(at_sum,aes(x=fct_reorder(BusinessTravel,attr_avg),y=attr_avg))

gg<-gg+geom_bar(stat="identity")

## Labeling
gg<-gg+xlab("Amount of Travel")+ylab("Yearly Attrition")
##Print
gg
```



*Quick Exercise: Create a bar plot showing average attrition by department instead of travel*

```{r}

at_dept<-at%>%
  group_by(Department)%>%
  summarize(attr_avg=mean(attrit))

at_dept

```


```{r}
## Bar Plot with aesthetics: mean attrition as height, business travel as category
gg<-ggplot(at_dept,aes(x=Department,y=attr_avg))
## Use bar plot geometry, height of bars set by level observed in dataset. The Identity tasks it to plot what is in the dataset.
gg<-gg+geom_bar(stat="Identity")
## Print
gg
```

```{r}
## Same asethetics, but now ordered by level
gg<-ggplot(at_dept,aes(x=fct_reorder(Department,attr_avg),y=attr_avg))

gg<-gg+geom_bar(stat="identity")

## Labeling
gg<-gg+xlab("Department")+ylab("Yearly Attrition")
##Print
gg
```

## Dot Plots

A dot plot can be a good way of displaying conditional means as well. Many times dot plots are more easily understood if they are horizontal, so we'll use `coord_flip` to make it horizontal. It flips the x and y-axis.

```{r}
at_sum<-at%>%
  group_by(BusinessTravel)%>%
  summarize(attr_avg=mean(attrit))

at_sum
## Now a dot plot
gg<-ggplot(at_sum,aes(x=reorder(BusinessTravel,-attr_avg),y=attr_avg))
gg<-gg+geom_point(color="orange",size=5)
gg<-gg+xlab("Travel")+ylab("Average Attrition")
gg<-gg+coord_flip()
gg
```

## Conditional means using two predictors

We can use graphics to display conditonal means at multiple levels of predictor levels. There are a couple of ways to get this done. When using bar plots we've got two basic tools: location and color. In the first example, we're going to plot attrition by travel and gender, We'll use color to indicate gender, and location to indicate travel.


```{r}
## Summarize attrition by travel AND gender
at_sum<-at%>%
  group_by(BusinessTravel,Gender)%>%
  summarize(attr_avg=mean(attrit))

## Get the results
at_sum
```

```{r}
## PLot it using a bar plot
gg<-ggplot(at_sum,aes(x=fct_reorder(BusinessTravel,attr_avg),y=attr_avg,color=Gender))
gg<-gg+geom_bar(stat="identity",aes(fill=Gender),position="dodge")
gg<-gg+ylab("Pr(Attrition)")+xlab("Frequency of Travel")
gg
```

```{r}
## Plot it using a dot plot
gg<-ggplot(at_sum,aes(x=reorder(BusinessTravel,attr_avg),y=attr_avg),color=Gender)
gg<-gg+geom_point(aes(color=Gender),size=5)
gg<-gg+coord_flip()
gg
```


* Quick Exercise: Create either a bar plot or a dot plot showing attrition by department AND field of education *

_Side_ _Note_: Colors

What if we want to change colors? This is a little tricky for most people at first. `ggplot` thinks in terms of palettes, so you need to associate a palette with a characteristics of the graphic. Below, I replace the default palette with my own ugly one. 

To change the scale for fill, instead of the automated palette, you're telling Rstudio to manually use the mypal palette. This changes the color of the fill. 

Repeat the code to change the color of the outline. 


```{r}

## Changing Colors
mypal<-c("lightblue","orange")

gg<-gg+scale_fill_manual(values =mypal )

gg<-gg+scale_color_manual(values =mypal )
## Print
gg
```

You can also use `RColorBrewer` which has a wide variety of palettes already built. Below I use the qualitative palette creatively named "Set1".

```{r}
## Another way, using color brewer palettes: 
gg<-gg+scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1")

gg

```


## More Variables: faceting

We can continue this logic with three variables. Now we're going to summarize by Travel, Gender and Marital status. Here we're going to use an additional tool in our arsenal: Faceting. Faceting means making multiple graphs with the same structure. In the code below, we will arrange positions based on travel, color based on gender, and then split the graphic by marital status. 

```{r}

at_sum<-at%>%
  group_by(BusinessTravel,Gender,MaritalStatus)%>%
  summarize(attr_avg=mean(attrit))%>%
  arrange(-attr_avg)

at_sum
```

```{r}
gg<-ggplot(at_sum,aes(x=reorder(BusinessTravel,attr_avg),
                      y=attr_avg,
                      fill=Gender))
## Bar plot, with unstacked (dodge)
 gg<-gg+geom_bar(stat="identity",position="dodge")
## Separate out by Marital Status
gg<-gg+facet_wrap(~MaritalStatus)
## Change orientation to sideways
gg<-gg+coord_flip()
## Print
gg
```

## Multiple Predictors for Conditional Means

One solution is to use facets, or lots of little graphs, which show how the pattern varies across different groups. In this case, our groups will be defined by gender and work/life balance. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
## Using Facets

at_sum<-at%>%
  group_by(BusinessTravel,Gender,MaritalStatus,WorkLifeBalance)%>%
  summarize(attr_avg=mean(attrit))%>%
  ungroup()%>%
  arrange(attr_avg)

view(at_sum)

gg<-ggplot(at_sum,aes(x=fct_reorder(BusinessTravel,attr_avg),y=attr_avg))
gg<-gg+geom_bar(stat="identity",aes(fill=MaritalStatus),position="dodge")
gg<-gg+facet_wrap(~Gender+WorkLifeBalance,ncol=4)

gg<-gg+ylab("Proportion of Employees Who Departed")+xlab("Category")
gg<-gg+theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))
gg<-gg+ggtitle("Departure by Gender and Level of Work/Life Satisfaction")
gg

```


Plot predicted attrition by education field, department, and gender. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
## Using Facets

at_sum<-at%>%
  group_by(EducationField,Department,Gender)%>%
  summarize(attr_avg=mean(attrit))%>%
  ungroup()%>%
  arrange(attr_avg)

view(at_sum)

gg<-ggplot(at_sum,aes(x=EducationField,y=attr_avg))
gg<-gg+geom_bar(stat="identity",aes(fill=Gender),position="dodge")
gg<-gg+facet_wrap(~Gender+EducationField,ncol=4)

gg<-gg+ylab("Proportion of Employees Who Departed")+xlab("Department")
gg<-gg+theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))
gg<-gg+ggtitle("Departure by Gender and Education Field")
gg

```
